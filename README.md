# Where in the world?

A web application inspired by a challenge from the website www.frontendmentor.io 

## What it does?

The app displays all the countries in the world. I grab the data from an API call REST Countries. 

API Website -> https://restcountries.eu

You can filter the results by searching by country or region. If you click on a country it takes to 
another page with more information of that country

## Install 

    - git clone https://github.com/fedeemilo/rest-countries-api.git

    - cd rest-countries-api

    - npm install

    - npm start
